Stimuli taken from: 
Enríquez, M. Á. (1978). Mapping semantic memory for native English speakers, native Spanish speakers and Spanish-English bilinguals.

Original experiments reported in Collins and Quillian (1969)

Experiment recreated in OpenSesame, all details about server etc. the same some the previous experiments.

---
fixation point: 500 ms
ISI (blank screen): 200 ms
stimulus: no time limit: onscreen until the participant presses a key
response buttons were counterbalanced: half the participants answered "m" for true and "z" for false, for the other half it was reversed.

---------------------------------------- 

Changed (outdated or unfamiliar references, assumptions):

A corporal is a man. -A corporal is a person.
A wac can fly. -A brigade can fly.
A rambler is a store. -> A sedan is a store.
Chicken is venison. -> Chicken is beef.
A ford is a datsun. -> A ford is a toyota.

Tucson is a county -> Aarhus is a region.
A Chrysler is a car -> An Audi is a car.
A Pontiac is a vehicle -> A Tesla is a vehicle.
A derringer is large. -> A berry is large
A bazooka has arrows. -> A banana has bones.
A mortar is a musket. -> An apple is an orange
A cannon is a bomb. -> An apple is a building.
Japan has Mao. -> Japan has Biden.
A mulberry has needles -> A daisy has needles.
Bologna is gray -> Mozarella is gray.
A compact is big. -> A lipstick is big.

Changed these (maybe difficult for a vegetarian to answer that sausage is food?):

Ham is pink.
Beef has fat.
Mutton is digestable.
Veal is veal.
Pork is meat.
Sausage is food.


To these:

Bananas are yellow.
Beans have protein.
Bread is digestable.

## Method

The sentences were displayed one at a time

two index fingers resting on the two response buttons.

The sentences were grouped in runs of 32 or 48, with a rest
period of approximately 1 min between runs.

Each sentence appeared on the screen for 2 seconds, and was followed by
a blank screen for 2 sec before the next sentence.

The S was instructed to press one button if the sentence was
generally true, and the other button if it was generally false,
and he was told to do so as accurately and as quickly

Sentences. There were two kinds of semantic hierarchies used in
constructing sentences for the experiments, 2-level and 3-level.
In Fig. 1, a 2-level hierarchy might include bird, canary, and
ostrich and their properties, whereas the whole diagram
represents a 3-level hierarchy. A 2-level hierarchy included
true PO, P1, SO and S1 sentences; a 3-level hierarchy included
true P2 and S2 sentences as well. Examples of sentence sets with
2-level and 3-level hierarchies are given in Table 1.4 As
illustrated in Table 1, equal numbers of true and false
sentences were always present (but in random sequence) in the
sentences an S read. Among both true and false sentences, there
are the two general kinds: Property relations (P), and superset
relations (S).

The sequence of sentences the S saw was randomly ordered, except
for the restriction to four hierarchies in each run. The runs
were counterbalanced over Ss with respect to the different
sentence types, and each button was assigned true for half the
Ss, and false for the other half.

In analyzing the data from the three experiments, we have used
the mean RT for each S's correct responses oflly. Error rates were on the
average about 8 ~o and tended to increase where RT increased.

To evaluate the differences shown there for true sentences, two
separate analyses of variance were performed: One for the
2-level runs and one or the 3-level runs.

## Results

The difference between P sentences and S sentences was significant,
F(1, 60) = 19.73, p < .01, the difference between levels was
significant F(1, 60) = 7.74, p < .01, but the interaction was
not quite significant, F(1, 60) = 2.06.

For the 3-level data, the difference between P and S sentences
was significant, F(1, 60)= 27.02, p < .01, the difference
between levels was significant, F(2, 60) = 5.68, p < .01, and
the interaction was not significant, F < 1.
